# StatusChanger
New version of Enterprisey's Status Changer for Wikipedia that works with my status template

This code is based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Enterprisey/StatusChanger.js

It is a modified version compatible with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RhinosF1/Template/StatusMonitor

If you have made a change, please do not commit to master branch or close issue until the code has been copied onto Wikipedia.

Use the Edit description: Copying [link] for change [commit id]. 

Can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:RhinosF1/StatusChange.js

If there is a critical bug or security issue, Use the Wikipedia email function for RhinosF1 or contact rhinosf1 on the freenode IRC network. You should also notify an interfacte admin if it requires disabling and then raise an 'unavailable' issue. If I do not respond within 15 mins, raise a bug and use 'security' as the title and email again.
